			<h1>The Ferracciolo Family</h1>
			<div style="text-align: justify;">
				<p>
					This is a temporary landing page until I can set up a nicer looking one one. 
					Please browse the family members below.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://brendan.ferracciolo.com">Brendan Ferracciolo</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If your last name is Ferracciolo and you would like a subdomain (firstname.ferracciolo.com), please contact <a href="mailto:epicwolverine@me.com">Brendan</a>.
					I'll point it wherever you'd like (and update it upon request) for life for a small one time fee (probably ~$15) just to help cover the registration cost of owning the domain (it's cheap but not free).
					I'd eventually like to set this domain up with G Suite at some point so that we can get cool features like unlimited Google Drive space and Gmail-powered custom email addresses (like firstname@ferracciolo.com).
					This wouldn't be free though. At the time of writing, it would be $10/month per account. Let me know if you're interested in this.
